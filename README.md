# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-from-MRI
Brain tumor segmentation project using the BraTS dataset. Phase 1 applies preprocessing, U-Net-based deep learning for MRI segmentation, and evaluation. Next phases will extend to advanced architectures and a custom loss function for improved segmentation accuracy.
